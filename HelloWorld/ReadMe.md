This is the first project in TypeScript.
The goal is to get input (string that represents name) from the user via the console and to print "Hello, givenName!".

Requirements:
1) Create a 'greeter' class with a 'greet' method that takes a name parameter.
2) The greet method should return a string that says "Hello, <name>!".
3) Create a 'main' function that prompts the user to enter their name.
4) Use the Greeter class to greet the user and print out the message to the console.
